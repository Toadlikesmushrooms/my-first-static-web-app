            <h2>North Shore Beaches</h2>
            <p>
              The North Shore of Auckland is home to a series of sandy bays that stretch from Cheltenham to Torbay. The suburbs of Auckland's North Shore have a sunny seaside flavor, and there are more than ten attractive sandy beaches for sunbathing, walking, and swimming . Many of New Zealand's successful international sailors began their careers as youngsters at North Shore yacht clubs . You'll see white triangles of sail decorating the bays on a breezy day. You'll also notice kayakers touring the coastline, rounding the tall sandstone headlands between one beach and the next. Offshore, the tree-covered volcanic cone of Rangitoto Island provides a uniquely Auckland backdrop and a fascinating destination for more experienced paddlers and sailors . When easterly winds blow onshore, a swell develops across the outer Hauraki Gulf bringing surf to these normally tranquil beaches. Surfing enthusiasts can enjoy the waves at these beaches .
